I learned today that there exist M_DISC versions which can store up to 25 gigabytes (which each cost approximately $30) and some which can store up to 100 gigabytes (which each cost approximately $70) and which can be ordered from Amazon dot Com.

What I plan to do for the next M_DISC backup of karbytes is purchase three of the 25 gigabyte M_DISCs (which is approximately $120 to order (standard shipping included)) via Amazon dot Com. Then, after those discs arrive, I plan on burning the entire karbytes collection (up to a specific date after I order those M_DISCs) to each one of those discs and then storing those discs inside of the blue (allegedly fireproof and allegedly waterproof) zipper-locking compact disc case I have in my room in an (unlocked) metal safe and putting all the discs which are currently inside of that blue case into other storage containers in my room designated for storing karbytes-related digital storage media.
