1. On 12_OCTOBER_2024 karbytes downloaded each of the 107 zip files which comprise the collection of public domain digital artifacts named karbytes from a public Wi-Fi network. 

2. On 12_OCTOBER_2024 karbytes revised the prose in the following two web pages which describe the contents of karbytes:

web_page_0: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/preparing_to_make_mdisc_set_on_10october2024/

web_page_1: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_16/

3. On 12_OCTOBER_2024 and 13_OCTOBER_2024 karbytes updated the file sizes of the aforementioned zip files on the web page whose Uniform Resource Locator is prefaced with "web_page_1:" in this note. During that time, karbytes also re-listed the files within each (minimum M_DISC sized) folder on that web page to be in alphabetical order (according to how those files are listed on karbytes' local Ubuntu machine and how ChatGPT-4o listed them when karbytes asked ChatGPT-4o to arrange the file names (within a specific (minimum M_DISC sized) folder) in alphabetical order).

karbytes noticed that almost all of those zip file sizes were updated to larger file sizes while those that were not were already the correct file size. 

karbytes thinks that might be a result of downloading each of those zip files from its respective GitHub repository instead of generating that zip file by compressing a folder which is located on karbytes' local (Ubuntu) machine. GitHub might be adding some overhead data which causes the zip files it generates to be slightly larger than what the karbytes' laptop generates by compressing files inside of a folder into one zip file.
