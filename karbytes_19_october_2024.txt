The story web page which the previous note refers to contains the following quote:

“Just because I am immortal does not mean I intend to waste any of my time. I would instead rather spend as much of my (infinitely long) time being continuously conscious doing things or beholding things which I derive a sense of enjoyment or value from rather than to be less discerning about how my time is used.”

The previous note contains commentary about why the body of intellectual property named karbytes exists and why that body of intellectual property is licensed by its creator as public domain and made available by its creator on the public World Wide Web. This follow-up note elaborates on that commentary in the previous note:

Suppose that only the creator of the body of intellectual named karbytes is ever aware of the existence of any component of that collection of intellectual property.

Then the creator of that body of intellectual property would proceed with generating new components of that collection, curating existing components of that collection, and being the target audience of each component of that collection. 

To be precise, the creator of that body of intellectual property would proceed as though the size of the actual audience of that collection is larger than one (because doing so is a form of entertainment and motivational constraints for that author). 

Also, just because only one person (i.e. the author) has accessed that collection thus far does not imply that persons other than that author will ever, in the future, access that collection. 

Hence, it makes sense (according to the author of that collection (who is also the author of this note (because this note is part of that collection))) for the author to tailor that collection to appeal to as broad of an audience as possible (while constraining the target audience to beings who have the cognitive capacity to understand and appreciate the subject matter of that collection).

If the author of that collection only tailored that collection's content to appeal to that author, then that content might become sloppy over time and acquire relatively cryptic syntax which is only comprehensible to that author (and also just not be as interesting nor relevant to beings other than that author).

Even so, the author of this note concludes that it is better for the author to create content which that author finds to be meaningful (at least at the time of that content's creations) and to keep that content preserved in as immutable of a format as possible (for the sake of preserving the author's memories and helping the author attain new insights) than to not generate nor curate any intellectual property at all.

The process of creating, curating, and reviewing the body of intellectual property named karbytes gives the author of that intellectual property a sense of purpose (i.e. structure by which to set goals and measure progress towards such goals) and a sense of satisfaction in making progress towards purpose-related goals. 

Without such a creative and intellectual enterprise to undertake, the author of this note assumes that the author would likely experience more dramatic cognitive decline and decrease in overall happiness and health over time as a result of more entropy taking over the author's mind and substantiating physiology. Having goals (or at least preferences) and ways to measure progress towards goals (or at least the ability to discern whether a present-moment experience is satisfying or unsatisfying) seems (according to the author of this note) to increase the degree of agency the experiencer of those goals and experiences has (and agency seems to be a "counter force" to entropy).
