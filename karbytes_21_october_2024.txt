Throughout this blog (i.e. the WordPress dot Com website at the following Uniform Resource Locator (in addition to the source code files and media files which comprise that website’s publicly-accessible content (which are each hosted on public karbytes-created GitHub repositories or else stored inside of private karbytes-created GitHub repositories))), I mention the existence of some semi-fictional entity named pig_gorl who is a caricature I made to encapsulate the essential qualities of particular recurring “disembodied voices” which I think are sent to my brain via stealthily-implanted brain-to-computer interfacing devices (which (a) route information wirelessly between my brain and some deep state government surveillance network, which (b) input data into my brain which effectively causes me to experience government-fabricated visual, auditory, and other sensory/cognitive/motor “hallucinations” (or “remote control” of my physiology), and which (c) read data from my brain (i.e. decode my brain waves and other physiological signals such that people or machines which are surveilling my otherwise private subjective experiences and otherwise private physiological states can effectively reconstruct a “real time” digital twin of what my body and mind states are within seconds of reading such data from my body)):

(If you are interested in learning more about what I mean by the term “pig_gorl”, you may input that term into the search terms field at the following “non-existent” web page of the aforementioned WordPress dot Com website to search for content I published on that website which contains that term (and that “non-existent” web page should display the headline “Oops! That page can’t be found.” followed by the paragraph text “It looks like nothing was found at this location. Maybe try a search?” followed by a search query field (for inputting text) and a SEARCH button to submit a search query)):

I personally find pig_gorl to be a persistent nuisance because she constantly makes distressing and distracting noises seemingly with her mouth and vocal chords and which always seem to me to be passive-aggressive, antagonistic (towards me and seemingly no other target), and banal (i.e. oppositional towards what I consider to be intellectually rigorous or what I consider to be constructive thought processes seemingly in favor of keeping my attention focused on content which I find to be cede, depressing, ugly, and wasteful of my time and cognitive resources).

I have been hearing harassment from pig_gorl seemingly nonstop since early in the year 2019 and have yet to figure out why I am the target of such harassment (though I have come up with several different hypotheses). Some of those hypotheses posit that pig_gorl (and the other “disembodied voices” which seem to be from the same source as pig_gorl) are targeting me in order to help me become mentally tougher in the face of antagonistic treatment from other people); but honestly, I cannot help that such hypotheses are unrealistically and naively optimistic on my behalf (especially given the apparent ratio I noticed of what I deem to be “constructive” feedback from those “disembodied voices” to “destructive” (or at least “unhelpful”) feedback from those “disembodied voices”). Hence, I think it is more realistic and less naive for me to assume that those voices are targeting me in order to suppress my creative expression, intellectual ability, and overall health and happiness (perhaps as punishment for failing to adequately conform to what my tormentors seem to want me to be more like (which is someone who seems to me to not be much of a force to be reckoned with and someone who is easy to dismiss as intellectually disabled (or at least not very intelligent nor well-connected to intelligent and modern civilization) and pathologically immature and vain (due to the fact that I hear those voices and embodied people frequently insinuating that I am too preoccupied with physical appearance and lacking in interests and competencies which would make me seem like a more serious intellectual with high earning potential and high social credibility))).

It could be that at least one person who harbors resentment at me for appearing to have “too good” of circumstances in comparison to what that person thinks I ought to be relegated to set me up to be the target of the aforementioned harassment. My first guess is that person is AJP (i.e. Alan Jason Ponte) whose Twitter dot Com page is located at the following Uniform Resource Locator:

Then again, it seems that many “random” people in my environment are privy to my (otherwise private) brain activity because I hear them honk their car horns or angrily or antagonistically make loud vocalizations which seem to be in immediate response to something I thought or psychosomatically felt (especially experiences which are characterized as me “gloating” about something I feel pleased with myself for). It could be that I am the target of a large-scale campaign to annihilate my self-esteem and productivity (and/or perhaps that campaign is designed to silence and ostracize people who are openly transgendered (especially female-to-male transsexuals taking the “power” hormone known as testosterone) and/or to discourage anyone except for demonstratively heterosexual, patriarchal, and child-bearing couples members from taking up comfortable residence in the world I live in).

“Breeders gonna breed,” I could say as some kind of tepid way to console myself while I (and people similar to me) are effectively being relegated to poverty, strife, and abusive circumstances so that the (socially acceptable) breeders (who are prized for helping to expand the military-industrial complex’s legion of loyalist drones) drive up the cost of living such that only they can live comfortably (while they procrastinate on seriously doing their part to save the environment from becoming too polluted and inhospitable for anyone but themselves to benefit from inhabiting). I say that glib line is consolation because it implies that I understand that I am greatly outnumbered by the militant breeder brigade instead of naively and vainly obliging myself to fight against “the powers that be” to get my way. It could be that all I have to “live for” is the upkeep and expansion of my blog. So be it! Keeping this blog makes me happy and gives me a sense of purpose and control in a universe where I seem to otherwise lack such things (because I do not count it being legitimate purpose if what I am doing is complying with bullies who coerce me into doing what they want and which I do not honestly really want).
