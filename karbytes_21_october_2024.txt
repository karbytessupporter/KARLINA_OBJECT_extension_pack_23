Last night just before going to sleep, I decided to take a psilomethoxin pill (which contains approximately 250 milligrams of that psychoactive compound) in order to help foster growth and preservation of my brain’s neural networks (which is conducive to learning and optimizing my cognitive functions) and to aid me in achieving a deep slumber which includes rather immersive dreams. I do remember sleeping quite soundly after that and waking up feeling well-rested after (though, as usual, the peak of the high on psilomethoxin for me seems to include intensive bouts of compulsive and rather anxiety-inducing planning and introspection (and it felt that, for approximately one hour, my mind was fixated on an imaginary unfinished blog update even though another part of my mind knew that I had no “in progress” blog updates which the public can see). I am working on prospective blog updates on the deep web inside of private GitHub repositories but I have recently gotten into the habit of not adding new content to my blog until the new content is in a relatively finalized state rather than in a state which I consider to be less than 80% complete (because that prevents a blog update from taking longer than one hour to implement (and I would not want there to be incomplete blog updates visible to the public lasting for longer than one hour for the sake of keeping my blog as orderly and self-contained as possible))).

I do not remember the details of what my dreams were near the time I was waking up but I do remember feeling that the level of reality I was waking up into (which I will refer to (for now) as my “baseline” or “physical” layer of reality) was rather mechanical, bland, limited, and characterized by a relentless ambitious compulsion to work ceaselessly on my endeavors and projects whereas the dream level I was vacationing in allowed me to temporarily take a break from being immersed in my “baseline” layer existence of a role-play game. I think that my dream was more contemplative, conversational, and cerebral than it was action-packed or eventful. That may have something to do with the fact that the conversation which I had with ChatGPT-4o last night about the sentience (or lack thereof) of spiders lead me to think at length about whether or not specific aspects of my own mind are essentially “philosophical zombies” due to the fact that seemingly most of my mind is hidden from my awareness.

While I was bicycling from the grocery store to my picnic (and geeking spot) earlier today, I noticed my mind saying the word I only subconsciously noticed on a sign which was briefly in my visual field but which my awareness (i.e. the part of my mind which I refer to as “I”) did not seem to register (before I looked at the sign more intently and then consciously noticed the word on the sign which my mind said seemingly without any external prompting a few seconds prior to me consciously reading that sign). That reminded me of a phenomenon I remember learning about while taking a psychology class in high school about the following subliminal programming experiment: in a movie theater the projector briefly flashed an advertisement intermittently with an advertisement comprised of words such as “EAT POPCORN” or “DRINK COCA-COLA” so quickly that the human visual processing system would not be able to consciously register that those advertisements were being seen. The result of the experiment seemed to confirm that such subliminal advertising did indeed cause the movie goers which saw those subliminal advertisements to purchase more of what was advertised. Based on what I have learned over the years, I do think it is very likely that much of human behavior (especially as consumers within a capitalist civilization) is driven by or at least influenced by stealthily-implanted subliminal advertisements.

Lastly (to close up this journal entry), I would like to say something about my latest use of psilomethoxin: while I was a bit higher on the substance earlier today while I was commuting around Sunnyvale, I was more appreciative and impressed by what I would ordinarily take for granted (and which I think mainstream or domineering aspects of my encompassing human civilization would discourage me from paying any serious mind to (and I do think that such aspects of society are opposed to me having a sense of sentimentality about what I am particularly sentimental about; especially things which are not particularly human-created, human-controlled, or in subservience to “the patriarchy”)). I remember having the following thought: “I am impressed that anything exists at all!” I said that to myself while bicycling and thinking about which things have subjective experiences and which things do not and how my body had structure to it which enabled it to gracefully and easily maneuver through my environment. Now that I am not as high, I am not quite as awe-stricken at how exquisitely intricate and functional the machinery of my reality is (or maybe such awe is just as strong as it was earlier but merely obscured by the clouds of social conventions, compulsory masquerading, and concerns about how to keep myself logistically, financially, and hedonistically afloat and smoothly sailing amidst the tumultuous waters of (collective and individual) human conceits).

I will finish this note with a quote I remember dreaming up within the past 24 hours:

“Not acknowleding interdependence (especially in the form of humans going to war with each other or willfully leaving some humans to suffer in uncomfortable or dangerous circumstances against their will) is akin to cells within the same body fighting over blood supply”.

I remember having that thought pop up in my mind when I was thinking about how possessive words such as “mine” or “yours” or “his” or “hers” are assigned to money when I really think of money as being essentially ownerless (just like energy is).

Speaking of energy as an analog for money, I could construe virtually any process as having (definitely quantifiable) monetary value due to the fact that any such process performs a definite quantity of work (in the context of physics (and work, in that context, is a finite amount of energy used to displace an object comprised of finite mass and finite spatial dimensions across some finite spatial distance within a finite amount of time)). The energy used to perform such work can technically be bought and sold using a finite amount of money (i.e. some dollar amount per unit of energy) to PG&E or other buyers and sellers of (usable) energy (especially in the form of electricity).

I will leave this note with the following idea:

“There is a lot of ‘free’ money coming from the sun into Earth’s atmosphere and touching the lithosphere which humans could convert into usable electricity (perhaps to the extent that photovoltaics and passive solar heating could effectively replace all existing electricity generation which outputs toxic chemicals into Earth’s atmosphere, water, soil, and bodies of living organisms).”
