I have been saying recently to myself that my website updates have been occurring in a manner which is better than I seemingly could have consciously planned for those updates to be (as a result of following my intuition and allowing it to "magically" lead me to places in my website(s) which need revision without me knowing that those particular portions of my website(s) need revision). I wonder if that has something to do with the future being just as real as the past from a larger-scale frame of reference than what is available to me from the relatively limited frame of reference I am writing this note from and my intution (i.e. part of my mind which is in communication with intelligence which I hypothesize is transcendent of my relatively finite human nervous system (and, hence, able to access information from what seems to my current temporally localized vantage to be the future)) coercing my cognition and sensory experience (or the parts of those qualia I am consciously aware of and seemingly in control of) to align in a deterministic manner with some overarching "scripted" flow of events which is immutably and always "etched" into "the akashic records".

I was watching an interesting video last night which mentions a (controversial) phenomenon referred to as the "backward time effect" which seems related to what I posited in this journal entry. The search details of that video are as follows:

The "backward time effect" is described in a Wikipedia entry which I share the link to and an excerpt from below:

"Retrocausality, or backwards causation, is a concept of cause and effect in which an effect precedes its cause in time and so a later event affects an earlier one.[1][2] In quantum physics, the distinction between cause and effect is not made at the most fundamental level and so time-symmetric systems can be viewed as causal or retrocausal..."
