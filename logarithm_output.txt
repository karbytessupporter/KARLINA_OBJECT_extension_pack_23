Start Of Program
--------------------------------

This C++ program computes the logarithm of x in some given logarithmic base.

--------------------------------

Enter a positive real number, x, to take the logarithm of and which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for x is 16.

--------------------------------

Enter a positive real number, logarithmic_base, which is a positive real number other than one and which is no larger than 10000: 

The value which was entered for logarithmic_base is 2.

--------------------------------

result = logarithm(x, logarithmic_base) = logarithm(16, 2) = 3.99811.
