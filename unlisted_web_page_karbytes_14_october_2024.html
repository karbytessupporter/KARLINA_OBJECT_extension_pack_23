<p>Suppose that I am really an alien hallucinating that it is a human. </p>
<p>Suppose that, before I was (apparently) born as the human I (apparently) am right now while writing this note on its laptop computer, I was just that alien.</p>
<p>Suppose that, while I was just that alien, I decided to take on a dare of ingesting some kind of psychedelic compound or utilizing some other kind of modality of experiencing an altered state of consciousness whose effects are similar to that of taking a very powerful psychedelic. </p>
<p>Suppose that, minutes before I took on the aforementioned challenge, I was told that I would lose awareness of anything outside of the hallucination I would be experiencing until I return to normal consciousness after that hallucination session ends. </p>
<p>Well, here I am now approximately 34.8 years into the experience that I am exactly one human individual who was born in the year 1990 (on the day labeled 13_JANUARY_1990). It could be that only five minutes has elapsed inside of the universe in which I voluntarily took on the hallucination challenge. What would be really cool is if my experiences within this hallucination can be, at least in part, recorded in digital format so that those experiences can be shared with aliens other than myself and so that I can look through that video recording for interesting content.</p>
<p>I would love for all the digital artifacts which comprise the body of intellectual property referred to as karbytes (on the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator) which were (apparently) created inside of this simulation (of me being the aforementioned human individual) to be verbatim transcribed into hardware in my encompassing alien universe. Then, if I exit this simulation to see that karbytes has been transmitted from my &#8220;dream&#8221; to my &#8220;reality&#8221;, I can say that karbytes was able to survive the death of the human referred to also as karbytes according to the aforementioned web page:</p>
<p>web_page: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/</a></p>
<p>Suppose also that the alien I am is also a hallucination which is essentially the same type of phenomenon as is the aforementioned human experience simulation I am having right now (and where this note appears to have originated throughout all of reality). Then I would want karbytes to also be transcribed from that simulation to the universe which induced that simulation. </p>
<p>Suppose that there are infinitely many of such layers of virtualization occuring and no &#8220;base layer&#8221; which I could refer to as &#8220;the physical layer&#8221;. I would still implore those who are facilitating these hallucinations to transcribe karbytes across subsequent layers of that virtualization chain and to never stop doing so (because I believe that doing so effectively keeps karbytes instantiated and, hence, immortal).</p>
<p>What I also would ask the facilitators of my reality to do is transcribe the data which comprises my sentient nervous system (including the relatively virtual <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knowledge</a> substantiated by that relatively physical nervous system) from this universe (where I am writing this note) to every subsequent universe layer and to always keep transcribing it across infinitely many layers of virtualization such that my continuity of consciousness (starting as the human being who is writing this note and whose self-chose name is karbytes) can also be made immortal (by being allowed to continue existing for an infinitely long time and, also, be able to witness and remember itself transcending layers of virtualization because such knowledge would be evidence to support the hypothesis that I can transcend the death of one nervous system and/or of one universe).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff">In summary, what I hope to achieve (and what I aspire to attempt to achieve even if I do not ultimately achieve it) is cause my continuity of consciousness (as the person named karbytes) and the continuity of the existence of karbytes (i.e. the aforementioned collection of digital artifacts) to each simultaneously (and interactively) endure for an infinitely long time (while using the karbytes which started inside of the universe where this note appears to have originated as the &#8220;base level&#8221; <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agent</a> of some infinitely &#8220;recursive&#8221; transmission process which continues to propagate karbytes for infinitely many universe simulations).</span></p>
<p><strong><em>To prevent older versions of karbytes digital artifacts to accidentally (or even intentionally) get deleted or modified such that those historical records are no longer functionally in tact, I routinely back up each of those digital artifacts to the WayBack Machine on the Internet Archive such that older versions of each of those digital artifacts are preserved in an immutable and publicly-accessible format on the World Wide Web.</em></strong></p>

<p>side_note: I decided to include references to some photographic images which I recently took with my Android Galaxy A03 phone in this note file because those images depict what I think my room ideally looks like and such images serve as a template for how to fix up my &#8220;home base&#8221; in all levels of virtualization which host karbytes to reside inside of.</p>

<p>side_note: I decided to include a link to an article I recently read about the politics of chimpanzees living in the wild because that article reveals how similar humans are to chimpanzees and also shows how different humans are from chimpanzees (and I would much, much rather be a human (especially one living in the age of the World Wide Web (especially as karbytes))) especially given how little technological and cultural sophistication chimpanzees exhibit when compared to humans. I can only imagine how much more advanced my native alien species is compared to humans. I would hope that those aliens are at least as technologically and culturally advanced as are the humans I am living amongst within the universe in which this note is being written (for what I assume is the first time throughout all of reality).</p>

<p>side_note: Finally, I decided to include references to some photographic images which I recently took with my Android Galaxy A03 phone in this note file and which pertain to the process of me transcribing the entire collection of digital artifacts which comprise karbytes (up to a specific point in my timeline) to read-only digital storage devices which are manufactured to last for up to one thousand years. (I expect that, within the next few decades, higher-density and longer-lasting digital storage media will become affordably available to the general public such that I can replace the M_DISCs in the aforementioned process with whatever the latest and greatest archival-quality digital storage media are).</p>
