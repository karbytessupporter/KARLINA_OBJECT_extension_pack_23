<p>The following conversation transcript was slightly modified for stylistic purposes and taken from a conversation had between karbytes and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT-4o</a> at approximately 1:00PM Pacific Standard Time on 12_OCTOBER_2024. The conversation pertains to karbytes learning how to obtain a free phone number which can send and receive phone calls and text messages (within the United States) via <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Voice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Voice</a>. In order to set up a new phone number (using an area code from a nearby city), karbytes needed to provide its current (paid) phone number (which is associated with <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AT&amp;T</a> and uses a $30/month phone plan (and that phone number is <strong>(510) 631-9783</strong>)). karbytes learned about the Google Voice service while inquiring ChatGPT about how to determine whether or not karbytes&#8217; phone number was being blocked by a phone number karbytes was attempting to call. karbytes tried calling that phone number from the first Google Voice phone number karbytes registered and saw that the number karbytes was trying to call still went straight to voicemail. karbytes also tried calling other phone numbers with success and also called its own AT&amp;T phone number and talked to itself via the laptop and phone (and heard a slight propagation delay of approximately one second).</p>

<p>Is there a way to tell whether of not a specific phone number has blocked my phone number?</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>There is no direct or surefire way to confirm whether someone has blocked your phone number, as this information is generally not made available for privacy reasons. However, there are some signs that might suggest your number has been blocked:</p>
<p>1. Calls Go Straight to Voicemail: If your calls are consistently going straight to voicemail without ringing (or ring only once), this could indicate your number is blocked.</p>
<p>2. No Response to Messages: If you&#8217;re sending text messages and they are not being delivered or you don’t receive replies over a long period, it could be a sign of being blocked.</p>
<p>&#8211; On iPhones, if you’re sending iMessages and they remain blue (not delivered) or stay green after repeated attempts, this might indicate a block (although it could also be due to network issues).</p>
<p>&#8211; On Android, if your text messages say &#8220;sent&#8221; but not &#8220;delivered,&#8221; this could also be an indicator.</p>
<p>3. Busy Signal or Instant Disconnection: If you hear a busy signal or the call disconnects immediately after dialing, it could indicate a block.</p>
<p>4. Call Using Another Number: Try calling from a different phone number. If the person answers or the phone rings normally, it’s likely that your original number is blocked.</p>
<p>While these signs can indicate being blocked, they are not definitive proof, as network issues or the recipient having their phone turned off could cause similar behavior.</p>

<p>Is there a way to get a temporary new phone number via the internet?</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>Yes, there are several services that offer temporary phone numbers online. These numbers can be used for things like making calls, sending texts, or even receiving verification codes. Here are some popular options:</p>
<p>1. Google Voice</p>
<p>&#8211; Features: Free phone number for calling, texting, and voicemail. Available for U.S. users.</p>

<p>&#8211; Pros: Free, integrates with other Google services, reliable.</p>
<p>&#8211; Cons: U.S.-only, requires a Google account.</p>
<p>2. TextNow</p>
<p>&#8211; Features: Free phone number with texting and calling, available on both Android and iOS.</p>

<p>3. Burner</p>
<p>&#8211; Features: Temporary phone numbers for calling, texting, and even managing multiple numbers for business or privacy.</p>
<p>&#8211; How to Get It: Available via the Burner app for iOS and Android.</p>
<p>&#8211; Pros: Great for temporary use, highly private, ability to &#8220;burn&#8221; the number when done.</p>

<p>4. Hushed</p>
<p>&#8211; Features: Provides temporary and disposable numbers for calls and texts.</p>

<p>&#8211; How to Get It: You can purchase a Skype Number through your Skype account.</p>
<p>&#8211; Pros: Works globally, integrates with Skype for calls and messages.</p>
<p>&#8211; Cons: Paid service.</p>

<p>These services allow you to maintain your privacy and use a phone number temporarily for various purposes. If you only need a number for a short time, apps like Burner or Hushed are ideal. For longer-term use, Google Voice or Skype might be more appropriate.</p>

<p>I tried Google Voice and think it is a very cool service. Can text messages be sent to and from a Google Voice phone number?</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>[Memory updated]</p>
<p>Yes, you can send and receive text messages using a Google Voice phone number. Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<p>1. Sending Text Messages:</p>
<p>&#8211; You can send text messages from the Google Voice app on Android or iOS, or from the Google Voice web interface at voice.google.com.</p>
<p>&#8211; The messages will be sent using your Google Voice number, and recipients will see that number as the sender.</p>
<p>2. Receiving Text Messages:</p>
<p>&#8211; Texts sent to your Google Voice number will appear in the app or web interface, and you will be notified (if notifications are enabled).</p>
<p>&#8211; You can reply to messages directly from within the app or web interface.</p>
<p>3. Multimedia Messaging (MMS):</p>
<p>&#8211; Google Voice also supports MMS (multimedia messaging), so you can send and receive images, although support for sending group messages and multimedia files can vary depending on the carrier and region.</p>
<p>It’s a convenient way to manage texts and calls, especially if you want to keep your primary number private.</p>
<p>karbytes:</p>
<p>How long am I allowed to keep a Google Voice phone number?</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>You can keep a Google Voice phone number indefinitely, as long as you meet certain conditions to maintain the number. Google requires you to periodically use the number to prevent it from being reclaimed. Here are the key points:</p>
<p>1. Regular Usage: To keep your Google Voice number active, you need to use it. This means making a call, sending a text, or checking your voicemail at least once every six months.</p>
<p>2. Inactive Accounts: If you don&#8217;t use your Google Voice number for six months, Google may reclaim it, meaning you could lose access to the number. You&#8217;ll typically get warnings via email before this happens.</p>
<p>3. Number Transfer: You also have the option to port your Google Voice number to another service, which allows you to keep the number even if you no longer actively use Google Voice.</p>
<p>As long as you use the number regularly, you can keep it for as long as you like!</p>
