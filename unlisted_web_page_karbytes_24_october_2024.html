<p>I have been saying recently to myself that my website updates have been occurring in a manner which is better than I seemingly could have consciously planned for those updates to be (as a result of following my intuition and allowing it to &#8220;magically&#8221; lead me to places in my website(s) which need revision without me knowing that those particular portions of my website(s) needed revision). I wonder if that has something to do with the future being just as real as the past from a larger-scale frame of reference than what is available to me from the relatively limited <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frame of reference</a> which I am writing this note from and where my intuition (i.e. part of my mind which is in communication with intelligence which I hypothesize is transcendent of my relatively finite human nervous system (and, hence, able to access <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information</a> from what seems to my current temporally localized vantage to be the future)) is coercing my cognition and sensory experience (or the parts of those <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualia</a> I am consciously aware of and seemingly in control of) to align in a <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/causality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deterministic</a> manner with some overarching &#8220;scripted&#8221; flow of events which is immutably and always &#8220;etched&#8221; into <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_records" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;the akashic records&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>I was watching an interesting video last night which mentions a (controversial) phenomenon referred to as the &#8220;backward time effect&#8221; which seems related to what I posited in this journal entry. The search details of that video are as follows:</p>

<p>The &#8220;backward time effect&#8221; is described in a Wikipedia entry which I share the link to and an excerpt from below:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Retrocausality, or backwards causation, is a concept of cause and effect in which an effect precedes its cause in time and so a later event affects an earlier one.[1][2] In quantum physics, the distinction between cause and effect is not made at the most fundamental level and so time-symmetric systems can be viewed as causal or retrocausal&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;Aspects of modern physics, such as the hypothetical tachyon particle and certain time-independent aspects of quantum mechanics, may allow particles or information to travel backward in time. Logical objections to macroscopic time travel may not necessarily prevent retrocausality at other scales of interaction.[14][page needed] Even if such effects are possible, however, they may not be capable of producing effects different from those that would have resulted from normal causal relationships&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;Ernst Stueckelberg, and later Richard Feynman, proposed an interpretation of the positron as an electron moving backward in time, reinterpreting the negative-energy solutions of the Dirac equation. Electrons moving backward in time would have a positive electric charge.[22] This time-reversal of anti-particles is required in modern quantum field theory, and is for example a component of how nucleons in atoms are held together with the nuclear force, via exchange of virtual mesons such as the pion. A meson is made up by an equal number of normal quarks and anti-quarks, and is thus simultaneously both emitted and absorbed.[23]&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
